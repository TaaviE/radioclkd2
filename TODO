Things to do

- add something useful to, or configure autoconf/automake to ignore,
 NEWS, ChangeLog, AUTHORS

- Improved status reporting. Perhaps an hourly summary of each clock
suggested counters:
 correct decodes: full 60 seconds
 correct decodes: but under 60 seconds of data
 bad pulse lengths: short pulses (noise during low periods?)
 bad pulse lengths: long pulses (missing pulses)
 failed time decodes: short data (usually due to bad pulse lengths)
 failed time decodes: invalid data

- Finish documentation. Include a section on calibrating the offset of the clock.

- Check to make sure receiver is powered on correctly. add options to configure
which serial lines are high/low to power a clock.
